# Near earth object tracker

Using NASA's NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) to give a list of all objects passing by earth on any given day. Pick a date and see what's coming our way.

This project was created as part of a learning series I'm hosting for coders coming from the humanities and arts.
